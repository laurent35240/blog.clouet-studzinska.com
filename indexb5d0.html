		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this marvelous blog, it&#039;s gonna be great to cross post blog notes ! I&#039;ve really enjoyed my blog breaks, it&#039;s a moment for them but for me, a quite time that helps me remember that my life is full of things if not full of movies, theater plays, restaurants, readings, and so on... Many sweet thoughts to the parents and the baby Piotr. The kids keep asking : when are we going to Toulouse ? They are kinda jealous of their cousins. Amande is very happy for not being the youngest and baby Piotr has become a magic pedagogy point : you&#039;re not a baby like Piotr, you can do many things like stay on holidays with your grand-parents and enjoy the beach, the garden, Michelle French fries. She totally agrees and pity Piotr for not being able to enjoy all those marvels... yet ! Love. Lucile]]></description>
